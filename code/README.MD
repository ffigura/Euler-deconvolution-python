This repository contains a collection of Python codes and synthetic data 
example for a paper about the open-source package Euler deconvolution.The 
example data reproduce the synthetc results and figures shown in the publication.
The Euler deconvolution package `euler_python.py` is compatible with Python 2.7
and 3.7 programming language. To run the program,the numpy library is required. 
In addition, numpy is to run the complementary codes for the tests `estimates_statistics.py`
and the matplotlib is required to run the scripts `plot_functions.py` and `synthetic_test.py`.

1 - Abstract
----------------------
We propose a novel methodology to select reliable Euler deconvolution estimates throughout the vertical derivatives of the total-field anomaly, grounded on the capability of this quantity to locate anomalies due to its higher signal decay with distance. In applying Euler deconvolution to a small moving-data window, we compute the standard deviation of the vertical derivatives of the total-field anomaly for each data window. Then, we define the reliable source-location estimates as those estimates that are obtained by using the data windows with the largest standard deviations of the vertical derivatives of the total-field anomaly. For all tentative values of the structural index (SI), the reliable estimates with tight clustering define the correct SI and the mean of these estimates define the source position. We compared our methodology to select reliable Euler source-position estimates with two available methodologies in the literature based on the rejection criteria of data amplitude and of depth uncertainty. We conducted tests on synthetic noise-corrupted data to investigate the sensitivity of our method to deal with the presence of: i) an additive nonlinear background that simulates a regional field; ii) interfering anomalies with distinct amplitudes; iii) weak-, mid-, and strong-interfering anomalies; and iv) distinct noise levels. Most of tests in the sensitivity analysis shows that our methodology to select reliable Euler source-position estimates yielded better interpretation of the simulated magnetic sources than the methodology based on the rejection criteria of data amplitude and of depth uncertainty. The only exception was the tests with high noise levels in which the reliable Euler estimates selected either by our method or by the rejection criteria yielded poor interpretations. Applications to a real aeromagnetic survey from southern Brazil interpreted an isolated plug intrusion over the Anitápolis anomaly and a swarm of shallow-seated dikes with northwest-southeast trend over the Paranaguá Terrane.

2 - Content
----------------------

Both synthetic tests can be reproduced with these codes. The test 1 can be reproduced from the folder
`test_4_sources`.

Python codes:

	- euler_python.py
		General Python module containing the functions to compute de derivatives and Euler deconvolution.
	
	- synthetic_test.py
		Python script to generate the synthetic results. The script loads the total-field
		anomaly of a synthetic model from the file "synthetic_data.dat" and computes the
		Euler deconvolution using the functions in "euler_python.py". The results are 
		generated using the functions "plot_functions.py" for the plots and 
		"estimates_statistics.py" to compute the statistics of the data. 
		
	- plot_functions.py:
		Python script to generate the figures 2d, 4 and 7 in the first synthetic test. 
	
	- estimates_statistics.py:
		Python script to compute the mean of the northing, easting and depth estimates.  
	
Outputs: 
 
	- figures - figures 2d, 4 and 7 in the first synthetic example in the manuscript will be saved
			in this folder. The figures generated may differ from the publication and
			can be adapted in the script `plot_functions.py`.
						 
	- results - the mean of the northing, easting and depth estimates over the selected areas.

Test data:

	- input/synthetic_data.dat
		Synthetic magnetic data presented in figure 2d generated using the Python
		packaged "Fatiando a Terra": http://fatiando.org/. This data is an example
		used in the current publication.
	
3 - Prerequisites
----------------------
The Python program for Euler deconvolution "euler_python.py" and the scripts "synthetic_test.py"
and "estimates_statistics.py" require the Python package "numpy", and the script "plot_functions.py"
requires the Python packages "numpy" and "matplotlib". 
The easier way to get Python and all libraries installed is through the Anaconda Python 
distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). After installed Anaconda, install the libraries 
by running the following command in your terminal:

	conda install numpy matplotlib

The program for Euler deconvolution `euler_python.py` and the algorithms `synthetic_test.py`, 
`plot_functions` and `estimates_statistics.py` are compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3.7.
 
4 - Parameterization
----------------------
These are the two parameters of our methodology for Euler deconvolution: window size and the percentage of solutions to keep. 
The moving data window size is defined in the parameter `winsize` and the percentage of the solutions that will be keep is defined in the parameter `filt`.

Additionally, the structural indices are defined in the array `SI_vet`, this array can receive as many SIs as desired.
The areas to compute the statistics about the mean of the northing, easting and depth estimates are defined in a polygon by the array `area_cla`.

5 - Running the files
----------------------
After Anaconda and the libraries are installed, you need to run 
the code `synthetic_test.py` to generate the results.
There are two easy ways to run the synthetic test `synthetic_test.py`

1. Via command line: 

	1.1 On linux based systems open the command prompt windows (terminal), and run the command:
	
	On Python 2.7: python synthetic_test.py 
	On Python 3.7: python3 synthetic_test.py 

	1.2 On windows based systems open the Iphyton console (Python 2.7) or 
	Anaconda Navigator and then Jupyter QtConsole (Python 3.7), and run the command:

	run synthetic_test.py

2. Open the Spyder program that comes with the Ananconda installation. In the Spyder, open
the example script "synthetic_test.py" and click in "play" inside the Spyder to execute it.

If everything runs ok, the figures and results shown in the first synthetic test of the 
publication will be saved, respectively, on the folders: `/figures` and `/results`.

The  module `euler_python.py` can be imported to an interactive Python session or called from
an external Python module. The functionalities are documented using standard Python
docstrings.

The files `synthetic_test.py`, `plot_functions` and `estimates_statistics.py` are
Python-based command line scripts. By using these scripts, the figures 2d, 4 and 7
and results of the first synthetic test presented in the publication can be reproduced.
The figures generated may differ from the publication and can be adapted in the script
`plot_functions.py`.
